# Style Challenge
Everyone will be provided the same HTML template that contains various text elements but lacks any styling. Each group will be assigned a specific theme for the shared HTML template. 

In your small groups, your task is to collaborate and style the shared HTML template using CSS to match your assigned theme. 

# Setting Up
In your small groups, <strong>ONE person</strong> should do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Click <a href="https://github.com/csctd/style-challenge">*here*</a> to open the “style-challenge” repository. </li>
  <li>Click the “Fork” button in the upper right corner. It will load a new page where you can just click the “Create fork” button at the bottom. A new page will appear with your own copy of the “style-challenge” repository. </li>
  <li>Click the “Code” button and click on the “Codespaces” tab. </li>
  <li>Click the “Create codespace on main” button.</li>
  <li>It will take a few minutes to load! Wait for a pop-up box to appear in the bottom right corner asking if you want to install extensions and click the “Install” button.</li>
  <li>It will take a few minutes to install all the extensions! It has finished loading once your screen reloads with an index.html, style.css and web page with the template.</li>
  <li>In the bottom left corner, click on the “Accounts“ button.</li>
  <li>In the drop-down menu, click the last option that says “Sign in with GitHub to use Deploy to GitHub Pages”. A new window will open but you can just close it. </li>
</ul>
